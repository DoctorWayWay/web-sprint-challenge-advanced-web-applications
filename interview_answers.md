# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. Explain what a token is used for.

- Tokens are used for user authentication. Every token should be unique.

2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

- Use private routes, some sort of user authentication system (like JWTs), and review the applications code regularly for any vulnerabilities.

3. Describe how web servers work.

- A web server receives a request, process the request, and sends a response based on the processed request. I like to think of it as how the Redux workflow goes. The action is the request, the reducer's reducing is the process of the request, and the output of the reducer is like the response.

4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

- **(C)**REATE
- **(R)**EAD
- **(U)**PDATE
- **(D)**ELETE
